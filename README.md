## Roker
Weather Guessing App

## How it Works
Simply press the menu icon to select a city. You will be shown the current weather conditions. Press the eye icon to reveal said city's temperature.

## Rules of the Game
A city is selected and the current weather conditions are revealed to all players. The first player guesses the current temperature of the selected city. Each player follows with guesses - the same number cannot be selected twice. After all players have guessed, the temperature is revealed. The player whose guess was closest has won the round. When a player guesses the exact temperature, it is called a **ROKER**. The next round begins with the player to the left of the previous round's starter.
